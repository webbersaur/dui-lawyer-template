## Email 2: Value-Focused (Longer Version)

**Subject:** Stop paying $100+/click - own ctduilawyer.com instead

---

Hi [Attorney Name],

Quick question: How much are you spending on Google Ads for DUI-related keywords?

If it's anything like most CT attorneys, you're paying $50-150 per click for terms like "DUI lawyer near me" - and that adds up fast.

I have an alternative: **ctduilawyer.com**

This exact-match domain ranks for the searches your clients are already making. Instead of renting clicks, you'd own the asset.

**What's included:**

- Premium domain (appraised at $1,700)
- Fully designed website with 10+ sections
- Mobile-responsive with click-to-call
- SEO built-in (Schema.org, meta tags, local optimization)
- Lead capture form ready to go

**See it live:** https://webbersaur.github.io/dui-lawyer-template/

**The math:**
- $4,500 one-time = ~30-50 Google Ads clicks
- A website that generates leads 24/7, forever

I'm offering this to a select few CT DUI attorneys. If you're interested, I'd be happy to walk you through a quick demo.

Worth a conversation?

## Phone Script (If They Respond)

**Opening:**
"Hi [Name], thanks for getting back to me. I'll keep this brief - I know your time is valuable."

**Pitch:**
"I own ctduilawyer.com - it's the exact match for what people type when searching for a DUI lawyer in Connecticut. I've paired it with a professionally designed website that's ready to launch. You'd just need to add your name and photo."

**Handle Objections:**

*"I already have a website"*
→ "This could be a landing page specifically for DUI cases, or you could redirect the domain to your current site. Either way, owning the exact-match domain has SEO value."

*"That's expensive"*
→ "I understand. Consider this: at $100/click for DUI keywords, the domain pays for itself after 35-45 clicks. And unlike ads, you own it forever."

*"I need to think about it"*
→ "Of course. I'm reaching out to a few attorneys this week - if someone else moves forward, I'll let you know. Can I follow up Friday?"

**Close:**
"Would you like me to send over the full sales page with pricing options? I can also set up a quick screen share if you'd like to see the site in action."

4. **Timing hooks**
